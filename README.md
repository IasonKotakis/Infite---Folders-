This is a script that I created with Python called Infinite Folders. 

This script is based like a "bomb" of uncontrollable folders. When the script is executed, it will start creating a sequence of infinite folders until the computer runs out of memory or when the user shuts down their system. The script will not autorun from startup and will only be executed once the user initiate that file.
